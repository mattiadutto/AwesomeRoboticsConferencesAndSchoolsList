## About
I created this half for fun and half for learning something new. Double check on official conferences/school website for the correct/updated information (and if you find some wrong info here, please open a PR/issue :D)

## Contributing
### Add/Update Conference or School
The `javascript` magic parses `json` files from the [www/data](www/data) folder that are manually updated. Files are divided per year and per type (e.g. `conf2022` or `school2024`).  
You can open PR directly with the addition/update you want to add. A github action is set to validate the updates against the schema at [www/data/schema.json](www/data/schema.json).  
After locating the right file, this is the json schema for an entry:
```json
{
    "shortName": "ABC",
    "name": "Aaaaa Bbbbbb Ccccc",
    "start": "yyyy-mm-dd",
    "end": "yyyy-mm-dd",
    "deadline": "yyyy-mm-dd",
    "city": "A tiny city",
    "country": "World",
    "link": "https://web-page",
    "addressLink": "https://location-web-page",
    "type": "Conference",
    "note": "Some additional info"
},
```

- `deadline`, `link`, `addressLink`, `note` can be empty, but why not adding this info if available?
- Keep `shortName` short (acronym usually)
- `yyyy-mm-dd` format is strict: 4 numbers for year, 2 for month (zero padded if necessary), 2 for days (zero padded if necessary), e.g. `2000-01-01`
- `deadline` can be paper submission deadline (for conferences) or subscription deadline for schools
- `country`: please write the country `Capitalized` and in English so that the flag sprite is found correctly.
- `link` should link to the conference/school web page. Prepend `https://` or validator may not recognized it as URI. The link will be anchored to the __Short Name__ entry
- `addressLink` should link to the conference/school location, e.g. city on the map. The link  will be anchored to the __City__ entry
- `type` can only be "Conference", "Workshop", or "School". I may use this info in future to handle better the files
- `note` Additional info that will be displayed soon in the table
- Not very important, but it may be nice to put the entry ordered by start date, since everything is already like this

#### School Data Addendum
For schools additional entry may be put:
```json
{
    ...
    "cost": ""
    "costNote": ""
},
```

- `cost`, the price, as a string (max lenght 20). Since prices vary a lot depending on lot of factors, put here the min/max (do not forget to put the currency with the proper symbol)
- `costNote`, here additional info about the price can be added. Can be any string (max lenght 100), e.g. I found this format the shortest but still including all usual info: _students/academics/other early(late) : â‚¬350(400)/400(500)/600(700)_. Do no put here things like meals/travel included to not overflow the popover. These additional info can be added in the `note` entry.
