Khatib, K. Waldron, J. Angeles, V. Parenti-Castelli, M. McCarthy, M. Stanisic, B. Siciliano and others. At the first symposium, which I organized in Ljubljana in 1988, we agreed that we would organize ARK symposia every two years in the area of the Mediterranean and the Alps. So far, 18 symposia have been held. The proceedings are published in the form of edited books, which have been published by Springer (initially Kluwer) from the very beginning."
