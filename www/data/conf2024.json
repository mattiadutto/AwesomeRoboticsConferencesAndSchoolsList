Khatib, K. Waldron, J. Angeles, V. Parenti-Castelli, M. McCarthy, M. Stanisic, B. Siciliano and others. At the first symposium, which I organized in Ljubljana in 1988, we agreed that we would organize ARK symposia every two years in the area of the Mediterranean and the Alps. So far, 18 symposia have been held. The proceedings are published in the form of edited books, which have been published by Springer (initially Kluwer) from the very beginning."

Consistent with our theme, we have arranged plenary keynotes from leading industrial and academic scientists, who will give forward looking visions as well as historical perspectives on our field. A broad array of scientific tracks will cover diverse topics of cutting-edge research and innovation on cyborg and bionic systems, which are concerned with hybrid fusion of organic and biomechatronic body parts with the integration of some artificial components or technology like bio-hybrid actuators and sensors. In addition to the high-profile keynotes, the conference program will feature invited sessions, oral and poster sessions, sessions for students and young professions, sessions for clinicians and entrepreneurs, and exhibits from vendors and universities."
