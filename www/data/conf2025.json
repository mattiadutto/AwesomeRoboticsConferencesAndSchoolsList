Rather than replacing us, our vision is that robots will complement us. We envision a hybrid intelligence where robots and humans together will be more able, effective, productive, efficient, and fun to work with. To realize a successful integration of these socially interactive robots into our society, we need to invest in a future where human-robot teams could become prevalent. To this end, we need to create a clear vision of this future and create innovations related to interaction models, social capabilities, and the skills of these robots to understand how they can work together with us."
