This is a crucial requirement of next generation control applications, such as autonomous passenger cars, or autonomous aerial, marine and ground drones for civil applications. In established industrial systems, such a capability can also bring significant benefits, reducing commissioning time and cost, and the effects of product/process variability. After a brief review of fundamentals of MPC, the course presents an overview of existing learning-based MPC methods, followed by a deep-dive into theory and applications of selected techniques for different problem settings. These include stochastic and unknown-but-bounded uncertainty, and reactive techniques. A discussion on advanced topics and active research directions concludes the module."

It has advanced from a pre-operative planning and post-operative assessment tool to emerging platforms for intra-operative guidance and navigation. Advances in imaging have enabled the development of new modalities beyond the conventional whole-body techniques such as MR, CT and US to enable in vivo, in situ tissue characterisation by the use of biophotonics techniques that can be integrated with robotic instruments. The development of 3D vision facilitates structural-functional fusion, accurate focused energy delivery, large-area in vivo microscopic imaging, motion adaptation, visual servoing, and navigation under dynamic active constraints. All these are important for the development of new surgical robots for minimally invasive surgery."
