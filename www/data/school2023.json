    "note": "Learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides advanced control systems with the capability to exploit real-time collected information to improve performance in face of uncertainty, at the same time maintaining high safety standards. This is a crucial requirement of next generation control applications, such as autonomous passenger cars, or autonomous aerial, marine and ground drones for civil applications. In established industrial systems, such a capability can also bring significant benefits, reducing commissioning time and cost, and the effects of product/process variability. After a brief review of fundamentals of MPC, the course presents an overview of existing learning-based MPC methods, followed by a deep-dive into theory and applications of selected techniques for different problem settings. These include stochastic and unknown-but-bounded uncertainty, and reactive techniques. A discussion on advanced topics and active research directions concludes the module."

    "note": "In this summer school at the Excellence Cluster Science of Intelligence in Berlin, we would like to explore alternative paths towards efficient and sustainable robot perception and learning: efficient AI for individual artificial agents and teams. Inspired by insights of biologically intelligent systems (e.g. ant colonies, fish schools, and honey bees) AI has been going through immense progress. Efforts range from discovering simple yet efficient behavioral principles that allow solving complex tasks, to novel biologically inspired technological developments, such as event-based cameras, which open novel opportunities for efficient robot perception."
