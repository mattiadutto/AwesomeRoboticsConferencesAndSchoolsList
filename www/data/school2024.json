    "note": "The machine learning summer school (MLSS) series was started in 2002 with the motivation to promulgate modern methods of statistical machine learning and inference. It was motivated by the observation that while many students are keen to learn about machine learning, and an increasing number of researchers want to apply machine learning methods to their research problems, only few machine learning courses are taught at universities. Machine learning summer schools present topics which are at the core of modern Machine Learning, from fundamentals to state-of-the-art practice. The speakers are leading experts in their field who talk with enthusiasm about their subjects."

    "note": "Foundation models (FMs) are large deep learning neural networks trained on massive datasets (e.g., with billions of parameters), which can be further adapted to a variety of downstream tasks with little or no supervision. For example, the BERT model released in 2018, one of the first bidirectional foundation models, was trained using 340 million parameters and a 16 GB training dataset. Just five years later, in 2023, OpenAI trained GPT-4 using 170 trillion parameters and a 45 GB training dataset. Rather than developing artificial intelligence (AI) from scratch, AI scientists use a foundation model as a starting point to develop AI models that power new applications faster and more cost-effectively. In recent years, this approach has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Analysis, and several other fields. In particular, multimodal foundation models, which are trained simultaneously with multiple modalities, have shown remarkable success in text or audio to image/video/3D generation."
